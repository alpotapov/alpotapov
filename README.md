👨🏻‍💻 Hi, I’m Alexander.

🚀 I believe the next generation of most valuable companies will be built in web3 space.

📱 I'm currently working on [HealthWallet](https://github.com/alpotapov/hewa_app) - your private data silo for permanent storage of blood test results.

🏆 I'm an active hackathon participant and am happy to test some cool ideas in a team.

📫 Have something cool to share with me? Telegram, Twitter: @alpotapov
